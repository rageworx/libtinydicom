# libtinydicom

## Version
 - 0.1.7.55

## Introduce
 - A DICOM tag read/write library for using C++/STL
 - Related in DICOM tag file (.DCM) read and write library is too far to get free in light size. So I made this to read and write DCM files for free and tiny ! It is still prototype and need to be enhanced.

## Project target
 - Basically this project targeted to has non-platform-dependency.
 - Just build it with your gcc or MinGW in shell (or MSYS) via make. Maybe there's no platform dependency.

## License
 - MIT License.
 - You can use my source code whatever you want.
 - But no warranty, just remember this please.

## Known VR (WORD)
 - See source code of dicomdictinary.cpp.
 - I have gathering more VR information, but it is really narrow to know. Absolutely limited.
 - Still making it keep updated for latest version, but too many VR and dictionaries may need more time for only myself.
